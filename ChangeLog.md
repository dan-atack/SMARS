# The Saga of SMARS

## Chapter One: The Creation of the Git Repo (Difficulty Estimate: 1)

### October 25, 2021

Can't do anything without a repository!

1. Create a remote git repository, and make a simple README file, to fetch to the local repo.

2. Do a 'git init' and then set the remote repo from a local workspace:

   git init

   git remote add origin https://github.com/dan-atack/SMARS

3. Verify the remote repo:

   git remote -v

4. Do a first git pull from the master branch:

   git pull origin master

5. Do an initial git commit and push that to the remote:

   git push --set-upstream origin master

## Chapter Two: The Typescript NodeJS Server (Difficulty Estimate: 5)

### October 25, 2021

Well, the first phase of this chapter was a bit of a freebie, now to start the actual work!

1. Bootstrap an NPM project:

   npm init

2. Install (that's the 'i' in the command shown below) additional packages needed for the project: Express (the server itself), Dotenv (for loading environment variables), CORS (for ah, preventing CORS-related errors) and helmet, which is a security thing. Following a tutorial here:

   npm i express dotenv cors helmet

3. Now that we have some nice node modules installed, add a .gitignore file with node_modules as its first entry. Do another git add/commit/push to test it out.

4. Install Typescript, using the '-D' flag to install it as a 'Dev Dependency,' meaning it will NOT be installed in the production environment:

   npm i -D typescript

5. Next, install the type definitions for the packages installed earlier:

   npm i -D @types/node @types/express @types/dotenv @types/cors @types/helmet

6. Create a Typescript configuration file (tsconfig.json) with basic default values for a simple Typescript project:

   npx tsc --init
